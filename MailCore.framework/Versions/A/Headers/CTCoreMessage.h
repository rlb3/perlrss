	@class	CTCoreMessage
	CTCoreMessage is how you work with messages. The easiest way to instantiate a CTCoreMessage
	is to first setup a CTCoreAccount object and then get a CTCoreFolder object and then use it's 
	convience method messageWithUID: to get a message object you can work with.
	
	Anything that begins with "fetch", requires that an active network connection is present.
